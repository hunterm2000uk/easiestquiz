# **App Name**: QuickFire Quiz

## Core Features:

- Question Set Generation: Generate a set of 30 questions with 4 multiple-choice answers each. Use a question pool to randomly select simple questions from an attached CSV file.
- Quiz Interface: Display one question at a time with a progress bar, countdown timer, and dynamic input methods (multiple choice buttons or numeric keypad) with instant feedback. Navigation is limited to moving forward only. When the answers are text then the player should be presented with 6 buttons/answers with only one being correct. When the answer is numeric they should be presented with a keypad to enter the answer.
- Timer and Response Tracking: Implement a timer that counts down from 2 minutes. Track user responses and provide immediate feedback upon selection.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A clean white or light gray for the background to ensure readability.
- Secondary color: A calm blue (#3498db) for the header and progress bar.
- Accent: A vibrant green (#2ecc71) for correct answers and red (#e74c3c) for incorrect answers.
- Use a full-screen layout, ensuring the quiz questions and options are easily viewable on mobile devices.
- Simple and clear icons for correct (✅) and incorrect (❌) feedback.
- Subtle animations for feedback and timer updates to enhance user experience.
